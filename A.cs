/// This worked in early 1980s before the "P=NP problem" disrupted object classes; then
/// we had no standard keywords in our programs like "partial classes", but we had "atomic"
/// and real "static" addresses. C# brought back this "static" keyword, and structures are
/// lazy-binded by (YACC) default. I changed that default, then, by symbols that 'backup'd
/// the stack by identified "locations" (virtual representations of real rooms). Now, I
/// realized that pre-empted the "default" second compliation phase, and it agressively
/// searched any atomic string for dot-completion. Let's add that feature here, for
/// obvious terminal-entry-completion. C# standard missed this bit for "rentrent" ("re-")
/// reductions, on the flip-side ("GC"). Today, this parsed, but the garbage can magically
/// grabbed it before it was used. ("YY".)

/// Some compliers computed partial strings by default, so restrict atomic structs to charater mode.
/// Byte-code is insignificant in ASCII mode; otherwise, UNICODE mode makes byte-code significant,
/// as it turns each character access into calls. Micro-code simulates that once ("O(1)") for each
/// optimal-O1 compilation. That seemed like an obvious break in C# for assembly, like how we
/// entered "bytes" in BASIC. Let C# atomic structures declare "<assembly/>"-assemblage, and
/// the default resource for the complier is "A" FILE ("reflection").
/// 
/// Signals are the streamed version of atomic structs, but we do not want to replace
/// atomic characters. Compilers default polymorphic code, which either exists as an
/// atomic structure or an enumeration. Software engineers license "magically" enumerable versions.
