# .NET Domain Assembler
Based on information technology currently charted to year 2040.

## Program
* Visualized cloud assemblies
* Simulated versus real kernel interaction
* Compiled to C
* Pure .NET parser

## Is there any simple explanation besides code comments?
Yes, the word infrastructure as layered on kernel systems is quite different from typical integrated circuits. This solution does not compete with .NET platforms that layer above its standard assembly layer. If we can visualize Debian.COM's package system with each significant .NET instruction contained in its own package, then we can fully implement the infrastructure as charted. Every layer above this either depends on the integrated circuits or its selection of instructional packages. It is quite opposite from an object-oriented file system, as commented.

## Market Analysis
Standard, "10 program lines."
